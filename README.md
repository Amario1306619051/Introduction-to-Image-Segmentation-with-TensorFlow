# Introduction to Image Segmentation with TensorFlow

This repository provides an immersive introduction to image segmentation using the TensorFlow machine learning framework. Image segmentation is a crucial task in various image analysis applications, going beyond object detection to segment images into distinct spatial regions of interest. In medical imaging, for instance, image segmentation is used to differentiate between different types of tissues, blood, or abnormal cells, enabling the isolation of specific organs. In this self-paced, hands-on lab, you'll explore training and evaluating an image segmentation network using a medical imagery dataset.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
* Comprehend the role of Neural Networks in solving image analysis problems
* Implement Transpose Convolutional Neural Networks
* Utilize Keras and TensorFlow 2 for image data analysis

Whether you're new to Jupyter Notebooks or need a quick refresher, you can also refer to [Using Notebooks](UsingNotebooks.ipynb) for guidance.

# Image Segmentation

Throughout this lab, you will engage in a series of exercises that delve into image segmentation, often referred to as semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves classifying individual pixels into specific classes, effectively performing classification on a per-pixel basis rather than an entire image. The primary focus will be on classifying pixels within cardiac MRI images to distinguish whether they belong to the left ventricle (LV) or not.

This lab assumes familiarity with neural networks, including concepts like forward and backpropagation, activations, SGD, convolutions, pooling, and bias. While it's not a deep dive into deep learning or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a basic understanding of these concepts is recommended. The lab employs Google's TensorFlow framework, so prior Python and TensorFlow experience can be advantageous but is not mandatory. The lab primarily involves setting up and running training and evaluation tasks using TensorFlow.

## Input Data Set

The dataset used consists of cardiac images, specifically MRI short-axis (SAX) scans, meticulously labeled by experts. The training set includes images of cardiac MRI scans along with corresponding expert-segmented regions (contours) that outline the left ventricle (LV). The goal is to classify each pixel in an image based on its association with the LV. The dataset involves grayscale DICOM images, originally 256 x 256 in size, and labels with a tensor of size 256 x 256 x 2, signifying the two possible classes for each pixel. The training set comprises 234 images, and the validation set contains 26 images for accuracy testing.

Please note that data extraction from raw images and preparation for TensorFlow ingestion are not demonstrated in this lab. Data preparation involves intricate steps that are beyond this lab's scope. Additional resources and information are available in References [[1](#1), [2](#2), [3](#3)].

This lab aims to introduce you to TensorFlow in the context of deep learning for image segmentation. While the tutorial may not cover all TensorFlow features, it will provide you with a foundation to explore TensorFlow for solving various machine learning problems.

# TensorFlow Basics

TensorFlow 2 has introduced significant updates compared to TensorFlow 1.X. One major change is that TensorFlow 2 operates in eager mode by default. Unlike TensorFlow 1.X, where you construct a model as a dataflow graph and execute it within a `Session`, TensorFlow 2 executes commands in the order they're called, similar to typical Python programming.

This lab employs the [`tf.keras`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview) library, TensorFlow's implementation of the [Keras API](https://keras.io/). Keras is a high-level neural network API designed for fast experimentation. It offers various built-in neural network layer types and supports both simple sequential models and more complex topologies through the Functional API. TensorFlow serves as the backbone, handling performance optimization under the hood.

The lab serves as an introductory guide to TensorFlow. While the tutorial won't cover all TensorFlow features, it aims to equip you with the necessary knowledge to leverage TensorFlow for your machine learning tasks.
